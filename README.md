# VAS Performance Analysis

**VAS Performance Analysis** is a powerful tool designed to help organizations analyze VAS (Value-Added Services) logs to detect trends, downtimes, and risks. By leveraging advanced data analysis and visualization techniques, this tool offers insights into the performance of VAS, allowing for proactive decision-making and risk management.

Built with **pandas**, **Plotly**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **SQLAlchemy**, and **Dash/Streamlit**, the tool processes log data, identifies trends, detects anomalies, and presents the findings through interactive visualizations. The solution is designed to make it easy for users to explore large datasets and draw meaningful conclusions to optimize VAS performance.

## Features

- **Data Analysis**: Process and analyze large VAS log datasets to identify performance trends and potential risks.
- **Downtime Detection**: Identify periods of downtime or performance degradation in VAS.
- **Risk Management**: Analyze potential risks by visualizing key performance metrics and trends.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Use **Plotly**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn** to create interactive charts and graphs that help visualize VAS performance data.
- **SQL Integration**: Leverage **SQLAlchemy** to pull log data directly from SQL databases for real-time analysis.
- **Dashboard**: Use **Dash** or **Streamlit** to create an interactive, user-friendly interface that displays visualizations and analysis results.
- **Real-time Analysis**: Update visualizations dynamically based on the latest data input.
- **Exportable Reports**: Generate downloadable reports of analysis results in various formats (e.g., CSV, PDF).

## Technologies Used

- **pandas**: For data manipulation, analysis, and cleaning.
- **Plotly**: For creating interactive, web-based visualizations.
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn**: For static and advanced visualizations.
- **SQLAlchemy**: For database connectivity and efficient data querying from SQL databases.
- **Dash** or **Streamlit**: To build interactive, user-friendly dashboards and interfaces.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive exploration of data and analysis within a GitHub-friendly notebook format.
